# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor-Implementation
•	Utilized Icarus Verilog (iverilog) to compile the Verilog code and GTKWave to analyze waveform.
•	Integrated modules such as Program Counter (PC), ALU, Register File, Data Memory and Control Unit.
•	Executed RISC-V instructions for arithmetic logic, memory access, and branching, insuring ISA compliance.
•	Tested the design rigorously, validating correctness of instruction types (R, I, S, B).
